Just scratching an itch of an idea I'm having after looking over the new Apple TV TVML/JS syntax. Help needed please jump in.

### Getting started

```
npm install
```

### Start the server
```
node server
```

### Run the server using nodemon (automatically restarts on changes)
```
gulp start
```

### Routing

Any template from the templates directory is accessible via `localhost:3000/templates/{templateName}.xml.js`
